#3. Write a sequence of assembly instructions that will calculate the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of an integer. For example, the result should be 5 for an input of 199, since the binary representation of 199 (11000111) contains 5 ones. Assume that the integer in question is in $a0 when the program starts, and leave the result in $v0. Hint: Use and to inspect the least-significant (rightmost) bit, then shift and repeat.
